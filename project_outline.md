# InfoMentor Home Assistant Integration - Project Outline

## Overview
A comprehensive Home Assistant integration for InfoMentor school communication platform, providing real-time access to school schedules, news, and timeline entries for Swedish families.

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Authentication (`auth.py`)
- OAuth-based authentication with InfoMentor
- Session management and token refresh
- Multi-pupil account support

#### 2. API Client (`client.py`)
- RESTful API interface to InfoMentor endpoints
- **Timetable Endpoint**: `/timetable/timetable/gettimetablelist` for school lessons
- **Time Registration**: `/TimeRegistration/TimeRegistration/GetTimeRegistrations/` for preschool/fritids
- Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Pupil switching capabilities

#### 3. Data Models (`models.py`)
- **TimetableEntry**: School lessons and educational activities
- **TimeRegistrationEntry**: Preschool/fritids care registrations  
- **ScheduleDay**: Complete daily schedule combining both types
- **NewsItem**, **TimelineEntry**: Communication from school
- **PupilInfo**: Student information

#### 4. Home Assistant Integration
- **Coordinator**: Data update coordination (30-minute intervals)
- **Sensors**: Multiple sensor types per pupil
- **Config Flow**: User-friendly setup via UI

### Key Data Properties

#### Schedule Day Properties
- **`has_school`**: ANY scheduled activity (lessons OR care)
- **`has_timetable_entries`**: Only actual school lessons 
- **`has_preschool_or_fritids`**: Time registrations for care

This distinction is crucial for accurate child type detection.

### Child Type Detection Logic

#### Fixed Algorithm (v1.2)
1. **Primary Check**: Any timetable entries → **School child**
2. **Fallback Logic**:
   - "fritids" time registrations → **School child**
   - "förskola" time registrations → **Preschool child** 
   - No clear indicators → **Preschool child** (default)

#### Previous Issue (FIXED)
- **Problem**: Used `has_school` property which included time registrations
- **Result**: Preschool children incorrectly classified as school children
- **Solution**: Now uses `has_timetable_entries` for accurate detection

## API Endpoints

### Timetable (School Lessons)
- **Primary**: `GET /timetable/timetable/gettimetablelist`
- **Fallback**: `POST /timetable/timetable/gettimetablelist`  
- **Data**: Subject schedules, teachers, rooms, times

### Time Registration (Preschool/Fritids)
- **Primary**: `GET /TimeRegistration/TimeRegistration/GetTimeRegistrations/`
- **Alternative**: `GET /TimeRegistration/TimeRegistration/GetCalendarData/`
- **Data**: Care schedules, attendance, leave days

### Communication
- **News**: `GET /news/news/getpupilnews`
- **Timeline**: `GET /timeline/timeline/getpupiltimeline`

## Sensor Types

### Per-Pupil Sensors
1. **Schedule Sensors**
   - `sensor.{name}_schedule` - Complete upcoming schedule
   - `sensor.{name}_today_schedule` - Today's activities
   - `binary_sensor.{name}_has_school_today` - School lessons today
   - `binary_sensor.{name}_has_preschool_today` - Care activities today
   - `sensor.{name}_child_type` - School vs preschool classification

2. **Communication Sensors**
   - `sensor.{name}_news` - School news count and content
   - `sensor.{name}_timeline` - Timeline entries count and content

### System Sensors
- `sensor.infomentor_pupil_count` - Total children in account

## Recent Major Fixes

### Authentication Form Submission Fix (v0.0.98) - 2025-12-09
- **Issue**: School selection page appearing when it shouldn't, causing wrong school routing
- **Symptom**: Users redirected to "Avesta kommun" or seeing school selection when manual login doesn't show it
- **Root Cause Discovery**: 
  - Manual browser login: submit username + password + **ALL 89 school fields** in one POST
  - Our code: only submitting username + password + viewstate fields
  - InfoMentor login form contains ALL school options as hidden fields (`login_ascx$IdpListRepeater$ctl##$url` and `$number`)
  - Browser submits everything; InfoMentor uses credentials to determine correct school
  - Our code wasn't submitting school fields, causing InfoMentor to show selection page or route incorrectly
- **Previous Misunderstanding**:
  - Thought we needed to "select" a school by navigating to its URL
  - Built complex scoring system to choose which school URL to visit
  - This was completely wrong - no navigation needed!
- **Correct Behaviour**:
  - Login form contains all 89 schools as hidden fields
  - Submit ALL fields (credentials + ALL school data) in ONE POST
  - InfoMentor determines school from username/password
  - No school selection page appears
  - No navigation to school-specific URLs needed
- **Fix**: 
  - Now extract and submit ALL hidden form fields, not just viewstate
  - Removed erroneous school selection navigation logic
  - Simplified flow to match real browser behaviour
  - School selection page should never appear now
- **Impact**: Authentication works exactly like manual browser login - clean, simple, reliable

### Dynamic Login Form Parsing (v0.0.99) - 2026-01-25
- **Issue**: Login flow became brittle when InfoMentor changed form fields or added non-hidden inputs
- **Fix**: Parse the live login form each attempt, capturing hidden fields, selects, checkboxes, and submit buttons
- **Fallback**: If the expected login form is missing, refresh the login page and re-parse before submitting credentials
- **Additional Safeguard**: Merge hidden fields (including the encoded viewstate and IdP list) into the payload and set the login postback target
- **Impact**: Authentication adapts to portal changes without hard-coded field names or stale form data

### School Selection Scoring Overhaul (v0.0.97) - 2025-12-09
- **NOTE**: This entire approach was based on a misunderstanding. See v0.0.98 for correct fix.
- **What we thought**: Need to select one of 89 schools by navigating to its URL
- **Issue**: Stored school selection was repeatedly used even when it returned no pupils
- **Symptom**: User kept being directed to "Avesta kommun" instead of correct "Örkelljunga kommun"
- **Understanding**: 
  - InfoMentor presents ALL 89 schools in a single form (as hidden fields)
  - Authentication happens on infomentor.se domains for all users
  - Username email domain matching is NOT useful (e.g., "callycode.com" won't match any school)
  - Most schools use `sso.infomentor.se/login.ashx?idp=` URLs
  - Some use `ims-grandid-api.infomentor.se/Login/initial?communeId=` URLs  
  - Some are demo/test environments that should be avoided
- **Root Cause**: 
  - Stored school (#98 Avesta) returned with automatic selection (score 1000)
  - Scoring system favoured demo/test entries over real municipalities
  - "Övrigt InfoMentor Demo" entries scored higher than actual kommun entries
  - No mechanism to detect and clear failing school selections
- **Fix**: 
  - Stored school now gets +500 bonus (not automatic win)
  - Completely redesigned scoring heuristics:
    - Real "kommun" entries: +200 (highest priority for Swedish users)
    - Standard SSO URLs (`sso.infomentor.se/login.ashx?idp=`): +150
    - Demo/test entries: -100 to -300 (heavy penalties)
    - User type (elever/vårdnadshavare): +25 to +30
    - Removed username domain matching penalties (not applicable)
  - Automatic clearing of stored school when auth succeeds but returns no pupils
  - Next attempt uses scoring to find correct school
  - Added better logging to explain school selection reasoning
- **Example Scores** (without stored preference):
  - "Örkelljunga kommun": 200 (kommun) + 150 (sso URL) = 350
  - "Övrigt InfoMentor Demo Web": -100 (övrigt) - 200 (demo title) - 300 (demo URL) = -600
  - Real municipalities will now consistently score higher than demo/test entries
- **Additional Fix**: Time-based retry avoidance
  - Skip authentication during first 5 minutes of each hour (suspected maintenance window)
  - Uses cached data instead if available and less than 24 hours old
- **Impact**: Integration now correctly selects real kommun entries over demo/test sites, with automatic self-correction when wrong school is stored

### Schedule Freshness Gate (v1.6)
- **Issue**: Data freshness sensor (and retry cadence) treated partially updated payloads as fresh even when some pupils failed to return schedules.
- **Fix**: Added a dedicated completeness check that tracks per-pupil schedule status, only updating the freshness timestamp when every pupil has a fresh schedule.
- **Storage**: Introduced `last_complete_schedule_update` so cached data can report true freshness after restart without misusing the legacy timestamp.
- **Observability**: Sensors now expose which pupils are missing or cached, and the coordinator keeps retrying aggressively until the set is complete.
- **Impact**: Eliminates false "< 1 day" freshness claims, improves logging, and clarifies why data is still considered stale.

### School Selection Heuristic Upgrade (v1.5)
- **Issue**: Authentication frequently diverted to the first municipality IdP (for example Avesta) instead of the correct school, leading to repeated login failures
- **Fix**: Added weighted heuristics that reuse the cached IdP choice, boost InfoMentor-operated endpoints, and prefer options matching the user's e-mail domain while penalising unrelated entries
- **Impact**: Automatic school selection now locks onto the intended IdP, avoiding incorrect detours and reducing the need for manual retries

### Today Schedule Date Calculation Fix (v1.4) - 2025-10-20
- **Issue**: Today's schedule showing incorrect date (e.g., Saturday schedule on Monday)
- **Symptom**: "Tomorrow" schedule correct, but "Today" schedule stuck on old date
- **Root Cause**: 
  - `get_today_schedule()` returned a cached value (`pupil_data["today_schedule"]`) set during data fetch
  - When InfoMentor servers had issues for multiple days, stale cached value was preserved
  - `get_tomorrow_schedule()` always calculated date dynamically, so it worked correctly
- **Example Scenario**:
  - Saturday: Fresh data fetched, `today_schedule` cached as Saturday
  - Sunday-Monday: Server issues, stale cache preserved (including Saturday's `today_schedule`)
  - Monday: `get_today_schedule()` returned Saturday ❌, `get_tomorrow_schedule()` calculated Tuesday ✅
- **Fix**: Modified `get_today_schedule()` to calculate date dynamically like `get_tomorrow_schedule()`
  - Now searches schedule list for current date each time instead of using cached value
  - Ensures correct date even when schedule data is several days old
- **Impact**: Today's schedule always shows correct date, resilient to server outages

### Home Assistant Restart Resilience (v1.3)
- **Issue**: HA restarts were forcing immediate authentication attempts, causing "Authentication Expired" errors
- **Cause**: Integration attempted fresh data fetch on startup even when recent cached data was available
- **Additional Issue**: Cached data was loaded as dictionaries but sensors expected model objects with attributes
- **Server Reliability Issue**: InfoMentor servers sometimes authenticate successfully but fail to return pupil IDs
- **Fix**: 
  - Load cached data from storage immediately on restart if less than 72 hours old
  - Added deserialization function to convert cached dict data back to proper model objects (ScheduleDay, NewsItem, etc.)
  - Added serialization function to properly convert dataclass objects to JSON-compatible dicts when saving
  - Defer authentication checks to background tasks scheduled 30 seconds after startup
  - Periodic background auth verification every 12 hours (non-blocking)
  - Automatic retry with exponential backoff when authentication succeeds but pupil IDs aren't retrieved (up to 5 attempts)
  - Falls back to cached pupil IDs when InfoMentor servers fail to return them
  - Manual retry service for when automatic retries aren't enough
  - Authentication failures no longer block integration startup or data availability
- **Impact**: Integration remains functional through HA restarts and temporary authentication issues
- **Behaviour**: Uses cached data immediately, verifies credentials in background without disrupting service, automatically retries when InfoMentor servers are unreliable

### Child Type Detection Fix (v1.2)
- **Issue**: Preschool children showing as school children in HA
- **Cause**: Incorrect use of `has_school` property for classification
- **Fix**: Added `has_timetable_entries` property and updated logic
- **Impact**: Accurate school vs preschool distinction

### Timetable Endpoint Migration
- **Issue**: Calendar endpoint mixed holidays/events with lessons
- **Change**: Switched to dedicated timetable endpoint
- **Benefit**: More reliable school lesson detection

### Property Clarification
- **`has_school`**: Kept for backward compatibility (any activity)
- **`has_timetable_entries`**: New property for precise lesson detection
- **Clear semantics**: Each property has a specific, documented purpose

### Schedule Fetching Optimisation (v0.0.31)
- **Issue**: Monday cache issues when schedule data wasn't available for the current day
- **Solution**: Modified date range calculation to always fetch through end of following week
- **Implementation**: Calculate days to next Sunday (13 - current_weekday) for consistent coverage
- **Benefit**: Prevents cache gaps and ensures complete week coverage regardless of fetch day

## Push Notifications (v1.7)

The InfoMentor Android app has a known issue where push notification registration fails.  This integration provides a reliable alternative.

### How It Works
1. The coordinator polls `NotificationApp/NotificationApp/appData` every 5 minutes.
2. New notifications fire the `infomentor_new_notification` HA event (title, date, type, pupil, URL).
3. If notify services are configured in Options, push notifications are sent to the specified phones automatically.
4. `sensor.infomentor_notifications` exposes the unread count and latest 20 notifications as attributes.

### Configuration
In **Settings → Devices & Services → InfoMentor → Configure**, enter comma-separated HA notify service names (e.g. `mobile_app_andrews_phone, mobile_app_partner_phone`).

### Manual diagnostics (buttons + service)
- Device buttons **Run diagnostics** and **Full refresh (clear cache)** call `InfoMentorDataUpdateCoordinator.async_diagnostic_poke()` — re-login, reset notification/auth backoff, then `async_refresh()`.
- Service `infomentor.diagnostic_poke` with optional `clear_cache` for automations / Developer tools.

### Files Involved
| File | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| `models.py` | `InfoMentorNotification` dataclass with `from_dict()`, `is_new`, `full_url` |
| `client.py` | `get_notifications()` fetches and parses the endpoint |
| `coordinator.py` | Polls, tracks seen IDs, fires events, calls HA notify services |
| `sensor.py` | `InfoMentorNotificationsSensor` — unread count + attributes |
| `config_flow.py` | Options flow field for `notify_services` |
| `const.py` | `NOTIFICATION_CHECK_INTERVAL_MINUTES`, `SENSOR_NOTIFICATIONS`, `EVENT_NEW_NOTIFICATION`, `CONF_NOTIFY_SERVICES`, button + `SERVICE_DIAGNOSTIC_POKE` |
| `button.py` | Diagnostics / full-refresh buttons on the account device |
| `services.py` | `diagnostic_poke` service handler |

### Automation Example
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "InfoMentor notification → push"
    trigger:
      - platform: event
        event_type: infomentor_new_notification
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app_my_phone
        data:
          title: "{{ trigger.event.data.title }}"
          message: "{{ trigger.event.data.pupil_name }} — {{ trigger.event.data.date_sent }}"
          data:
            url: "{{ trigger.event.data.url }}"
            clickAction: "{{ trigger.event.data.url }}"
```

## Known Limitations

### API Constraints
- **School Dependency**: Timetable availability varies by school
- **Data Timing**: Some data not available far in advance
- **Regional Variations**: Primarily tested with Swedish InfoMentor

### Integration Limits
- **Read-Only**: Cannot modify InfoMentor data from HA
- **Polling-Based**: Notification checks run every 5 minutes (not instant push)
- **Session Limits**: May need periodic re-authentication

## 🔧 Core Components

### Authentication System (`auth.py`)
- **OAuth Flow**: Complete two-stage OAuth implementation
- **Session Management**: Automatic session renewal and CSRF handling
- **Cookie Reuse**: Successful logins now persist the browser cookies in HA storage so restarts can resume the session without re-running OAuth.
- **Multi-Domain Support**: Handles both legacy and modern InfoMentor domains
- **Error Handling**: Robust authentication error detection and recovery

### API Client (`client.py`)
- **Modern JSON APIs**: Direct API communication (no HTML scraping)
- **Multi-Child Support**: Automatic pupil discovery and management
- **Data Retrieval**: Schedule, news, timeline, and calendar data
- **Rate Limiting**: Respectful API usage with configurable intervals

### Data Models (`models.py`)
- **Structured Data**: Type-safe data models for all InfoMentor entities
- **Schedule Parsing**: Complex timetable and time registration handling
- **News & Timeline**: Rich content models with metadata
- **Validation**: Input validation and data consistency checks

### Home Assistant Integration
- **Config Flow**: User-friendly setup with credential validation
- **Sensors**: Individual sensors per child with detailed attributes
- **Services**: Manual refresh and pupil switching capabilities
- **Stale Data Retries**: When data is older than 24 hours the coordinator retries roughly hourly with a randomised offset (to avoid :00 clashes) until fresh data is retrieved.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and user-friendly error messages

#### Services & Manual Actions
- **Targetable Actions**: All InfoMentor services expose HA's `target` selector so users can pick a specific InfoMentor device/account when running an action.
- **Backoff Awareness**: Manual refreshes now respect retry/backoff rules and return meaningful errors instead of silently doing nothing.
- **Diagnostics**: `debug_authentication` logs the detailed flow result, making it easy to attach output to GitHub issues.
- **Entity Cleanup**: `cleanup_duplicate_entities` supports scoped cleanups, dry-run reporting, and aggressive "wipe everything" mode without throwing exceptions.
- **Automation-Friendly**: Advanced users can pass `config_entry_id` in service data to scope an action directly from YAML.
